# Docker
## What is Docker?
Docker is an open source platform that enables developers to package applications along with all their dependencies into containers.

#### Containers:
- A Docker Container is a running instance of an image.
- A container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that contains everything needed to run an application.
- Containers are created form images.
- Containers are isolated from each other and the host system.
#### Images:
- A Docker Image is a read-only template that contains the application code, libraries, and dependencies.
- Images are usually built from a **Dockerfile**.
#### Dockerfile:
A text file with instructions for building a Docker image. 
#### Docker Engine:
The core of docker, which creates and runs containers on the host operating system.
#### Docker Hub:
A repository where developers can share and pull prebuilt container images.
